this looks like s scene from friends and seinfeld combined.
what a fucking joke of a ending, atleast it killed dumb and dumbers careers
the greyjoys and martells should be outraged that the north can leave so easily, and they&#39;d want to secede as well
how gracious of dany to leave the small council chamber undestroyed.
i recently rewatched got. the first four seasons were excellent, but as soon as the source material dried up, so too did the quality of the show. i could barely watch the final two seasons, because they seemed more like a parody of got, rather than actual got. it was as though d&amp;d had let the fanfiction writers loose on the scripts; because that was what those final seasons seemed like - a bad fanfiction written by a dany/jon shipper who wanted a tearjerker of an ending, but then didn&#39;t know what to do with the other characters, or who should be king, so they just stuck the perv that was promised on the throne and made sansa queen in the north, and arya a female christopher columbus, because their sole focus was on the ship, and everything else was forced into place in order to finish the story, once the tragic dany death scene was written.
look how they massacred my boy 😢
&quot;we appear to be missing a master of whispers&quot; that&#39;s you, dummy
before this season finished airing i literally said out loud that i’d be okay with anyone winning the game of thrones besides bran. after everything, bran?! 😭
i’d second ser bronne of the blackwater on that brothel proposal that should be first priority
the biggest villain is bran.<br><br>he refused to be lord of winter fell because he was the three-eyed raven. however, he had no problem being king (which is a bigger burden) also, he could’ve warned the right people  that daenerys was going bat-shit and was going to slaughter an entire city.  he could’ve saved countless lives. bran knew that jon was going to be a better ruler than himself. i base the last sentence on the fact that the best rulers have no desire to be rulers.
the scene sums up the failure of dan and dave
we could&#39;ve got bran warging a dragon but noooo
what a fuckin dimwitted king...!!!<br><br>bran as a king is stupidest idea... he was joke... nothing special about him...
you are master of grammar now too 😂
last scene feels soulless.
i love this ending!
this last episode my eyes rolled back so far i could see my cerebellum
this needs a laugh track
bran the broken😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
id love to just have a show with bran as king and that group as the council just solving kings landing problems. would be a funny great show.
i just like that bran got to be king which was his dream from the beginning.
such a joke still not over it that series was so good. they’ve fucked it up.
what a terrible script
bronn got that &quot;the fuck&#39;s i&#39;m here for?&quot; vibe going for the whole scene. poor guy just wanted to retire and have a castle for himself.
looks like a parody.
davos&#39;s stare after tyrion addresses bronn with all of his &quot;lofty titles&quot;. lol
making bran king was a huge middle finger and the biggest misstep of the entire series
you&#39;d think those &quot;most powerful people in westeros&quot; who made bran the king would have <i>insisted</i> on being installed as the small council.
so, <i>nobody</i> in westeros has <i>any</i> qualms about a king that has the ability to take over other people&#39;s bodies against their will?<br><br>that&#39;s a bloody terrifying prospect! i&#39;d say it&#39;s more terrifying than a queen that has dragons at her disposal!
sitcom
as dull and stupid the last hours of got are, i love bronns character writing til the end tho. from start to end. &quot;long may he reign.&quot;
they better make more seasons and write that danny never died and came back from the dead
if hes able to see everything into the future why is he even asking for the vacant masters of whatever positions? god this series ended bad.
this ending cracks me up 😂
now that i look back on this, literally feels like a parody, made by some brainlets on the playground about how cool it&#39;d be if certain characters were in positions of power.<br><br>&quot;okay hear me out on this next one, remember how sam was training to be a maester? imagine him grand maester. oh wait, what if, bronn&#39;s always been about making money and being paid the whole time, lets make a funny contrast by making him master of coin. it&#39;s genius!&quot;
seasons 5 and 6, very bad with some good moments, but still bad. seasons 7 and 8........gods be good!! just f***ing shite!!
i have the feeling that bran will become the new night king or something
cringe.
boooooooooo.
yet another thing that makes no sense to me is their choice of ruler. sansa rules the north, bran rules the 6, both thrones are the same house.
&quot;we appear to be missing good writers who are not cheap soulless husk&#39;s&quot;
the worst ending to an amazing long tenured show. bran was the dumbest choice for the iron throne.
who the fuck in their right mind would accept ‘broken’ as your suffix/nickname as a king lmao
those f*ckers destroyed a legendary series
creepy little bran who got body-snatched only cares about searching for his dragon weapon. nothing changed.
bran has the least development among the starks.
they need to work on a spin off based after the events of season 8 🤣 get good directors and script writers 🤣
this could have been something.<br>much like the final 2 (and a half) seasons.<br>alas.
at least they put the first knight back on the small council.
awful scene. bran is just terrible. isaac hempstead wright is a shocking actor
this scene feels like all the actors coming back for a 20 minute non-canon christmas reunion episode or something purely for fan service.
how did tally become grand master? he dropped out. also, the idea of brandon becoming king isn&#39;t bad, it just had zero foundation for it to happen. the entire series i waited for him to die, as got had no problem killing anyone, but i more likely expected him to sort of go off to some monastery and withdraw from the world.
not sure i&#39;d want to hear that story about,  a honey comb &amp; a donkey in a brothal.
garbage season.
my first order of business, pls stop calling me &quot;the broken&quot;. you know i got animal taking over powers right? how about something with that.
6 kingdoms? oh right. lannisters are dead
nice to see that sam forgot about the oath he had sworn to the nights watch, brienne forgot about the oath she had sworn to sansa yet now joins the kingsguard, bronn becoming master of coin despite admitting in a previous season that he’s never borrowed coin and doesn’t know the rules behind it, bran saying there’s no master of whisperers despite being able to see everything himself.<br><br>10/10 writing
seems like tyrion feels hella awkward contrasting his first experience being the hand and this second time. even i feel awkward
the &quot;dying with a belly full of wine and a girls mouth around my cock&quot; would have been a better line to end with.... anything but this...
tyrion is 100% the best man as hand
this is shitty writing
what is he going to do up against a dragon?
i know i am in the minority but i actually loved the final season.<br>i can see why some people disliked it, especially the ones who wanted dany to sit on the iron throne.<br>i do agree that the last two seasons felt rushed and they really should have stretched them both out to 10 episodes. there&#39;s plenty of characters and plenty of things they could have done and shown to stretch it out. <br><br>i do love bran becoming king. <br>throughout the series, dany had talked about breaking the wheel but by her dying, john being exiled to the north, and the people electing a king that really is breaking the wheel
night king bran
podrick becomming a white-cloak is one of the best endings this damned season gave us.
brandon the broken always cracks me up. is he called broken because he is crippled or broken because he is overpowered
beat show with the worst ending. i didn&#39;t think anything could&#39;ve topped lost
<b>king bran the undeserving</b> is the title they should’ve given him.
bran should have become a soulless tree or whatever sometime after they defeated the night king. his whole purpose was to give insight on the whites and on jon&#39;s identity as the true heir since everybody who knew had died.
“the boy that fell so he can fly” then why didn’t we get a final shot of him in the last dragons body flying through the sky?!? ohhh cause it would add to the heaping pile of plot holes on his vague powers even more so?! cool.
the only thing i like about this scene is seeing the least corrupt government (small council) the show has every seen and pod becoming a knight.
what a dumb ending
great scene!
pod as kingsguard seems so forced and undeserved.. guy became a knight 2 minutes ago
bronn is right about the brothels. they would be a way to get the &quot;coin&quot; back from the masses, and fund the rest of the realms projects.
laughable at best
if only varis is alive. they would look like they were just drinking in the pub
we appear to be missing the master of writers.
hahahaha😂😂😂😂 master of coin is supper funny
fops
dany is called &#39;unburnt&#39; because she can put her hand on a boiling kettle, but you can&#39;t tack on some cool titles to a guy that has all human knowledge, can warg into any creature and some humans, explored north of the wall etc? just &#39;bran the broken&#39;?
cringe season
<b>let me tell you why this scene is an insult</b> : in “game of thrones” every character is fighting to survive whether it’s for themselves, others or their house.. tyrion, was fighting for his name to stay alive. he’s fighting for his name to not be stricken from the history books. at every turn he was undermined by his family. he saves the city? pycelle tells him he won’t be in the history books. he wants casterly rock? tywin won’t allow it cos he’s a “creature”   who killed his mother at birth. <b>so</b> when his final scene is given.. he finds out that he wasn’t mentioned once despite all his efforts and it’s played for laughs.. his entire struggle is for a goofy joke.
convenient that westeros is an entire continent and entire countries can be represented by only a single person as if there are no other great houses in each kingdom
if only george rr martin would have gotten off his lazy ass and finished the stories properly instead of pursuit of side-quest plots and prequels, i expect this 8th season would have been so much better.  it so annoys my ocd that martin&#39;s adhd wouldn&#39;t let him finish...
grrm sweating in the corner as he too had the same ending for his books xd
it&#39;s funny how sansa refused to bend the knee to his own brother as king. 😂
i love how casual bryon and davos are considering he burnt half on his men at the battle of black water bay
why is the dude who got carried on someone’s back literally made king?? goddmn stupid writers. he isnt brn anymore remember he keeps saying that shit. what makes him king???? fuckng assholes ruined what could’ve been the greatest tv series in the history of tv shows.
why would he choose tyrion as hands is beyond me…. the man singlehandedly brought down the most powerful army and 2 dragons by being hand to dani…he even managed to have his queen’s loved one murdered….
gross
varys should’ve been in this scene 🤬
my biggest disappointment was bronn&#39;s appointment to the small council. this man is a mercenary with no loyalty or honor, while jon snow is exiled behind the wall. what a shame.
bruh
mf finessed the throne, now he wants a dragon too. killed exactly 0 soldier, never went to war. foh
tyrion will end up betraying bran. that traitor doesn’t know the meaning of loyalty
i finally read the books and man, season 7-8 are truly soulless and the lack of source material truly shows. at least house of the dragon is good
it still baffles me that bran ended up king.
i hate the bran the broken title. hopefully grrm won´t use it for real
garbage ending
this scene proves that, you don&#39;t have to be powerful to become powerful, just accompany with powerful people.
danny deserved better.
they beat zombies, but now had the long night &amp; long winter upon them.<br>the last scene warm sunshine?
i like that part of the ending. tyrion needing to deal with that group of battering kids is just hilarious. i imagine now he knows how his father might have felt with his own children. 😅
wtf this cripple become king now?
the fact that 14 year old wattpad fanfic writers can write a better ending than this sh!t
ned stark and the north rebelled for robert baratheon. robb stark and the north rebel for ned stark. sanasa stark and the north do nothing! guess they all of a sudden forgot? &quot;the north remembers&quot; 😂 what shite ending!
what happened with 3 eyed raven?
literally a joke. a bunch of good hearted but incompetent ministers.
did lighting cost too much during this season
the only ones happy will be the hoes in that kingdom. lol
lol the disappointed looks on their faces. hardest part to act in this part
this is the most bs fan fiction small council ever...<br>not a single one of them except tyrion should anywhere near minister position.
hahaha everyone kinda forgot what they were making in the first place. so we took the worst fanfiction available on reddit and made our final season 😂
the ending isn’t bad at all plot-wise. it’s just rushed.
marge, i&#39;m confused, is this a happy ending or a sad ending?<br>it&#39;s an ending, that&#39;s enough.
lawd.. men and their desperation to have their angry little inch fiddled with... that they&#39;ll desperately pay someone to do it, while pretending the paid person isn&#39;t repulsed....
to the got fandom: boycott everything by grr martin and hbo and everyone else until we get winds of winter. why didn&#39;t george finish years ago. hbo paid him to do the series, and d&amp;d ignored him and messed it up. and bran as king is bs! if that was martin&#39;s idea, now he knows what not to write.<br><br>boycott!!!!!!!!!!
wth was they go do to drogon?? he was already alone damn that&#39;s punishment enough
tyrion has the best job security.
well... that ending didn&#39;t get any better with age.
when you realize you wasted so much precious time by have watching the whole series and wasted money on getting the hbo and other got souvenirs just for this pile of garbage of an ending 🙄     i swear i would have been more satisfied if a crazy mad queen daenerys or mad queen cersie kept the throne 😔
whatta disgrace!!!   so pathetic  😢
worst ending in history of television the characters look so dumb and lifeless lol
nice parody
in the end bran played the game and won. won it for himself and for his house. he purposely made it known who jon is. probably saw that danny was a mad queen and it&#39;s a golden opportunity. he just needed to drive people to get rid of her to ensure the starks win. if jon would be king, his family win the game either way. in the end, he won and let his sister has complete control over the north knowing when he is no longer king, nobody could lay claim over his family&#39;s kingdom. i wish they didn&#39;t make bran emotionless and show that he played the game too by using his knowledge to win.
i think in the books jon will become king  and all the remaining starks and some of the people who helped them will be on the king’s council he will wed the dragon queen and they will have the song of ice in fire baby. oh and rickon will either the warden in the north or the king in the north. starks are one of very few families in game of thrones that don’t want someone in their family dead. they all actually love each other like real family similar to dorne in the books.
&quot;i once brought a donkey and a honeycomb into a brothel...&quot;  lol
a freaking disney ending
thank the idiot tyrion for the downfall of the show when he kiled tywin he kiled game of thrones
this is probably a few months or even more than a year after dany&#39;s death. i assume the event when they met and chose bran, it was already more than a month as sansa already made it to king&#39;s landing along with thousands of northern men. at the end of episode 6, arya already had a ship that would take months to build. the unsullied fleet too as we know dany&#39;s and euron&#39;s fleet were destroyed. majority of king&#39;s landing people were burnt, so they must summoned people from all over the piace to rebuild ships. would love to see the process behind choosing the small council as well, how they each come to their position. season 8 needs perhaps 10 episode instead of 6 which would&#39;ve made things clearer and easier to digest. hbo would happily fund it from what i heard. it&#39;s not all bad, just very very rushed.
bran at raven całe
i&#39;m happy with the council, but john could be master of war (or king lol), robert&#39;s bastard master of law and master of whispers..... i&#39;m not sure, someone help me out lol
seeing bran as king and sansa as queen was so painful for us watchers 😢😢😢
&quot;you master of grammar now too?&quot; 🤣😂🤣
bronn: the master of coin looks forward to helping the master of ships, but first he has to ensure we&#39;re not wasting coin, or soon there won&#39;t be no more coin. <br>davos seaworth: any more.<br><br>shireen teached him well.
i want to know about the jackass and the honeycomb
years later and i still can&#39;t believe this is how this brilliant show ended!
if they were gonna go this route, why on god&#39;s green earth did they not make bronn the master of war? in the same scene a few seasons ago, bronn admits that he has no idea how lending works, while explaining very competently to varys and tyrion the real dangers of a city under siege. not to mention his presence at the siege of riverrun, and the later battle with the dragons and dothraki. he&#39;s a knight and has worked closely with jaime lannister, who was the commander of cersei&#39;s ground forces during the last war.<br><br>not to mention, bronn should have gotten harrenhal, not highgarden. there is no shot in hell that giving a sellsword one of the most prestigious and sought-after castles in westeros and the capital of the reach does not immediately instigate conflict and war with the reach. house florent has been contesting ownership of highgarden for years because of their supposed blood-ties to house gardener. we know that harrenhal is unoccupied, and is often given to loyal lords, even if they don&#39;t have a massive army behind them, as was with petyr baelish. the castle is controversial enough that many people adhere to superstitions and don&#39;t really wanna mess with it, but bronn doesn&#39;t really care about that kind of stuff. and as long as he only staffs the parts of the castle that he&#39;s using, he&#39;s fine. <br><br>man, they just thought about absolutely nothing in the final season. so painful.
i&#39;m not saying this is bad in the absolute sense.  but it&#39;s fucking awful as an ending to got.  would have made a brilliant snl sketch though.
don&#39;t even know why youtube suggested me this video, maybe because it&#39;s the festival of the dead, and this last 2-3 seasons were dead ass trash af
i hope they enjoyed the shawarma.
why did they decide to make him such an emo dude
a cripple king, hand is a dwarf, small council consists of a cutthroat, a smuggler, a disappointment of house tarly, and an abomination from tarth. grrm finished his series with such a non-imaginative end.
i hate this so much. aside from brienne and tyrion, no one on the small council is qualified for their positions and the whole world in season 8 just feels empty as though the main characters are the only ones who live there
cringe
who won the game of thrones?<br>the iron bank!
what a bloody joke
the master of coin sure has his priorities in order😂😂
and so ended a show that was amazing for a long time, petering out like a joke without a punchline, because people in charge were not clever enough to come up with one.
what fuck is bran the broken 😂😂😂😂
no shade....they killed kings for bein too mean. the second a kingsguard sees bran&#39;s eyes glaze over....<br><br>what&#39;s gone happen?<br>🚶🏾‍♂️
bronn is the real winner of got
i once brought a honeycomb and a jackass into a brothel. <br><br>it was the sweetest ass i had ever seen. <br><br>😂😂😂
i very much prefer evil king brandon ending.
king bran... i want to jump
what show is this? it sure isn&#39;t got. this one makes me puke
the worst ending in the history of endings
i’m so glad bronn made it to the end. i always loved his and tyrion’s relationship.
boring scene 😂😂😂😂
this kind of scenes only shows that the essence of the series were tywin, cersei, jamie, daenerys, the night king, littlefinger, and all the bad guys 😂😅 without them got became bored
why was it 6 kingdoms again?
ah, so this is how &quot;friends&quot; ended.
the new concil would be fun and also fun to see how this wil turn out
the stupidest ending to a shower in history of shows!
what thrilling way to end the best season every in television.
the worst scene of got. they are in a chamber room and city that was destroyed,  flattened, the people were burned,  obliterated aaaaand here they are in a perfectly good condition chamber to play king with bran in wheels to rule an empty city and no army... wtf ??! really bad writing. 🤦‍♂️
half expected the seinfeld bassline to chime in as tyrion set up his joke.
people mad about the writing wanted dany to burn down kings landing too
i am going to make my ending <br>dany discovers that rhegar wasn&#39;t her real brother just some targaryen. so thire relationship whit jon won&#39;t be weird <br>he becomes king in the 7 kingdoms and dany dany queen they should make the north care about her or not i don&#39;t care let her just be his queen<br>let&#39;s manage to give sansa queen(i hate it though sansa is a oathbreaker but there is no stark left to give)<br>arya becomes a knight and have a training yard to train warriors and let nymeria return to her <br>bran should be thire witch advisor or whatever <br>the ene
how can we bypass youtubes strong arm greed tactics of disabling ad blockers!
cue the west wing music.
i havent even watched the series yet and yet this feels so dead comparing it to the few scenes i&#39;ve seen from the first few seasons
its fan made right?not season 8?
gendry should have been king as he’s the only one left with a claim<br>bran becomes his master of whisperers<br>davos master of ships<br>tyrion kings hand<br>brienne lord commander kings guard<br>bronn master of war<br>and find someone else for master of coin
i love bronn i do think he was given a little too many heroic scenes like trying to fight a dragon a nd saving jamie from certain death but u do like that he ended up as lord paramount of the reach
if they resurect daenerys since drogon took her, then i&#39;ll watch season 8
season 8 sucks ass
bran is too lazy to even sit the small council. why tf did he become king then?
bronn is lord paramount of the reach so he&#39;s unbelievably loaded. why would he even want to be master of coin?
hey, i would watch an entire season of this small council talking about new policies for the six kingdoms. hell, i’d watch 10 seasons of tyrion and bronn roasting each other, with occasional interjection from davos. can we start a gofundme to make this happen? 😁😁
dawg, this is utter shite.
a king seeing into the future...copied from dune maybe?
i can almost hear the recorded applause and clapping like in sitcoms
im not brandon stark not anymore i cant inherate lands or titles anymore <br>jamie im not that person anymore im sorry for what i did to you <br>brandon you werent sorry then if you were i would still be bradon stark <br><br>literally right after why do you think i came here
i would like to know how they are doing in westeros now, after all these years ... did bran find drogon? how is everyone? :d
so bad.
what if drogon take danny body to valeria and  on valeria some priests  raise her from dead. then danny open her eyes sees a mysterious man and he say welome home princess you are last heir to the valeriyan throne we are waiting for you to come back then princess the time is come you become the queen of whole world then shall i call you queen . queen your army is waiting for you. danny cant believe herself its all look like a dream. then she ask a man who are you. the man said i am loyal servent my name is agron . and this is my dragon  suddenly danny panicked . a large dragon with black eyes and red scales  first danny thought its same size as balerian no no! its twice the size than balerian it can easily hide the whole ocean with his wings then she sees a more than 100000 army strong and well equipped with weapons then she sees a dragon raiders with more than 100 dragons they are bigger than drogon then dany asked agron i want take back what rightfully mine  agron said queen your army is at your service we give ourlives for you our queen then danny said fine i want to find my unsullied and dorkrathi  i going to takeseven kingdoms<br>next scene<br>            unsullied in a name less land with less than6000  grey warm said we will definitely avange our queen first we have to raise our army then we attack seven kingdoms and i kill that bastard with my hands that time he hears a mild sound  one guy screamed dragon greywarm one sec thought its was danny then he thought gow was this possible may be i was delusional.............
what was the point of even looking for drogon? 😂
master of grammar now too? 😂😂
this isn’t a small council meeting, it’s an snl skit
it’s weird because you can’t help but wonder where is everybody? it seemed so lifeless
all these legendary writings, plot twists, emotional drama and whatnot from season 1 to 7, just to see them arguing which one brothels or ships should be reconstructed first.
i thought this was a parody when i first saw it.
who has a better story than bran the broken? so interesting they skipped over it for an entire season
bronn...start as catelyn stark escort and now as bran small council member
absolutely terrible
so weird seeing the council with different people coming out on top with unexpected people in the story i guess that’s why it’s called game of thrones have to fight or just survive to get a seat
my prediction to what the future awaits<br><br>bran stark became the king. he did not build a new glass garden for winterfell. the north became independent. when the crops failed, hundreds of thousands died. highgarden was given to bron, a man who knew nothing of agriculture. he was named master of coin, but he knew not a thing about management or even loans. he squandered too much on rebuilding brothels and they were forced to abandon important necessities. <br><br>cersei lannister had paid off the debt of the crown, but immediately borrowed again, leaving the crown in debt, and she’d never paid the debts of the seven kingdoms at all. westeros was not able to pay the debt and so could borrow nothing.<br><br>sansa stark had said she ensured the food would last through winter. but winterfell had enough food for one year, and they expected a longer winter. she thought to have the northern houses bring their stores to winterfell, but they only had enough for their own households, very few enough for a year, most even less. then they stayed on at winterfell, and with more mouths to feed, it was not enough. <br><br>yara greyjoy promised there would be no more raiding! but she promised to daenerys. and that promise was in exchange for the independence of the iron islands, which king bran did not grant her. many of the notherners died of hunger. they rioted and raided winterfell. it’s barely more than rubble now, their queen sansa killed in the riot. gendry died similarly at storms end. arya stark never returned to westeros.<br><br>westeros had much division. lords who were bannermen to the paramounts who voted for king bran, were angry that they were not given a vote for the new king. edmure tully and robin arryn resented that there was not more time so that they too could try to recommend themselves. the citadel was outraged that samwell tarly was named grand maester, and he lacked the knowledge or training to be a competent maester. petty wars and fractured kingdoms, none prepared for the famine.<br><br>unsullied died of butterfly fever and daario naharis died fighting the slavers. the dothraki who survived the disastrous strategy of the long night returned to their pillaging, worse than they ever were, blaming westeros for killing their khaleesi.<br><br>jon never forgave himself for what he did. it was so much more than the final betrayal of killing daenerys. he was sent into exile afterwards. never to have a family. he helped the free folk settle, then left to be alone. he was a kinslayer. an oathbreaker. a queenslayer. he loved you, and he could not bear the dishonor of what he’d done. the targeryen line dies with him<br><br>in essos, astapor and yunkai were taken back by the slavers and eventually meereen as well.the slaves fought for their freedom and took it. it was a terrible and bloody conflict. once they’ve tasted freedom, it starts a fire that will never die. but without such a powerful ally, and resources, it will take much longer. but the slaves won and when it was over, those that survived were free. it will take them a few more years to win that freedom everywhere. <br><br>whatever ill westeros speaks of daenerys, in slavers bay she is all but holy. the idea of freedom, the principle of it, will never die.<br><br>drogon lives. he is alone. feared and hunted. and one day he will return and burn the seven kingdoms to the ground
lol
hodor died for this crap
we seem to be missing the true king!!
all hail king bran? hell no!!
this is the dumbest ending and the dumbest set of council members there could ever be. this is something you could expect in a fan fiction. we have bronn who knows nothing about anything, has no friends or allies. tyrion who failed with everything he ever did post season 4. sam who became arch maester after 2 weeks of study. brienne and davos are fine but how is podrick a kings guard? also tyrion making up a nick name for the king
the most unconventional unanticipated counsel ever beyond realm of imagjnatiom😂
tyrion once again get his way so he won’t be executed
they literally wrote scenes for that stupid bar filled with fat ugly redditors to react to.
even as i watch this, i remember those two idiot writers.<br><b>sigh</b>
horrible
i really don&#39;t get all the hate this gets, maybe because i didn&#39;t read the books, because yall under every video crying because it didn&#39;t happen the way it did in the books lol. could it have been better? yes. but it really wasn&#39;t that bad of an ending to me
the best show ever aired and they ended it with the jackass joke... <br><br>goddammit, d&amp;d!
this literally feels like a sitcom
something tells me that bran is bloodraven and jon’s spin off serious will finally sit him at the iron throne with the legendary ice dragon.
so awkward
after reading the books, this finale feels even worse than before i read the books
nothing beats: &quot;i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel...&quot;
bronn on the small council is just as stupid as the character when it comes to thinking beyond giving, using up all his money and being good at fighting. just fan service. <br><br><br>bran would be a good king, but it wasn&#39;t earned in the show with the most asinine justification for him to become the king. <br><br>tyrion as hand is great. <br><br>sam as maester is earned too. he has shown his skills and has vast knowledge. <br><br>brienne of tarth as commander of kings guard is wuite fair too. <br><br>so is davos as the commander of ships and sea.
i dont get why the brought bran in for 2 seconds they really botched this ending .
honestly feel like this is the ending george wanted and that the reasoning behind why the final book remains unfinished is because he doesn&#39;t know how to appease fans.
bronn killed ser davos son
this feels weird 😭
back to politicking in the small council!
i turned off the t.v. and started chugging jack after watching this. the one that wrote this was probably wearing a hat with a propeller on it.
even after all this time this still hurts to watch.<br>bran: &quot;i don&#39;t want to be lord of winterfell, i don&#39;t want to be anything&quot;<br>also bran: &quot;lol imma king now boiiiii&quot;
this still feels so... wrong
why do you need to find drogon? leave him the fk alone.
med school drop out is the grand maester in this council. that’s pretty fucked up.
anyone ever wonder if drogon took her body back to mereen to the red priestess? would be interesting if that was the case for the jon snow sequel.
all of the sheep in this comment section 😂  copying and pasting each others comments
it still hurts... such a dissapointmen...
more like trader of the north
i still regret it that jaime didn&#39;t push him harder out of the window!!!
what is happening here
it just feels unfinished. hopefully the jon snow spin off series corrects the wrongs of d&amp;d
this ending makes no sense for got but its funny
what it could’ve been…
when you watch the first season, it&#39;s hard to believe this is the actual ending to a once great series. this? what a farce. like a poorly scripted comedy.
this council misses lord varys that much it makes me sad.
how can sam be the grand maester?! he fled oldtown before his training was completed, right??
send them dragons to look for the plot also. it went missing
is this real ?!? or a commercial?
the dwarf git erased darney tge queen. cowards rule then
so...uh, why ask where drogon is, if you can see everything?  &lt;.&lt;
i cant stop laughing during this scene
useless king &amp; a useless character..
maybe the creators were trying to lighten the mood since dani had just burned a whole city down and pissed a bunch of people off??🤷‍♀️
came back to this scene for the 1st time in 4 years. fuck me, it&#39;s worse than i remembered it 🤦
&quot;then i imagine you&#39;re not using them properly &quot; tho
wait wtf this is a real scene ?
brandon is the most useless character in got
bruh i cringed so hard... can&#39;t even imagine
i like bronn but he does not deserve all them titles and to be master of coin… sam, brienne and davos deserve to be there though
should&#39;ve made sure to kill that useless cripple
dwarf and disabled child wtf is this ending
bronn went from being the son to a man they wouldn’t know to master of coin. in my opinion, they should have him master of war rather than coin
they should proceed this show to s9 and make jon become master of war and he would ride drogon using his real name
literally all interesting characters with shades of grey are gone and only the goodie-two-shoe characters survived
show was buried in an unmarked grave and forgotten to time .<br>that’s how bad it was .
the hound was always right. “f**k the king!”
gods this series went to shit
had he lived, i feel the hound would&#39;ve been a great master of war.
only d&amp;d could make the audience hate when bronn talks
who in their right mind would have gave bron the reach  and made him master of coins.<br>this atrocity alone is enough to consider 8 as mass hallucination
como é que o brandon não consegue localizar o passarinho drogon 😂 se ele ainda é o corvo de 3 olhos? <br>depois da guerra ficou preguiçoso?
so wake me up when it’s all over!
so many book fans got pissed off at season 6-8 but.. as a person who could give less a shit.. it was mid. there were moments that made me scared there were moments that made me laugh. it was ok. i can see why characters do actions and don&#39;t see any major issue.
except for bronn everyone else had a positive role throughout the series..so you can call it a happy ending
every scene with tyrion was a pleasure.... until like season 6 lol. everytime there was a small council meeting, it was fantastic. season 8? holy shit it failed. <br><br>dick and dicker went from the most lauded tv directors to washed up - all because they got greedy and lazy. thousands of better fanfics were written for the show. and we got the worst one lol. <br><br>then with the books - grr martin has given nothing in years. <br><br>it&#39;s a shame that human hubris has destroyed beautiful art.
the star wars prequels, got season 8.... can&#39;t decide which is worse.
this ending feels like a slap in the face of the fans. give the stupidest character, that spent the entire show being drug all over westeros on a sled,  the throne.
most idiotic ending in all tv history
this end looks like a weird low budget porn
writers…shame!!! shame!!!!
now you guys know how we c&amp;c fans feeled when c&amp;c 4 was released.😬
a coach is responsible for his actions, time will tell if he made the right ones on these players.
this is awesome. everyone in this room has a good heart. bron is… uh… questionable but ok.
&quot;i ones brought a jackass and honeycomb into a brothel&quot;, still deciphering it!
ooof. feels bad man.
every board meeting ever, i swear.
it’s like a forced happy ending
wtf sir bronn of high garden??🤡🤡
this shows bollocks writing at it again, why ask where drogon is? use your powers bran you bloody muppet
well, only lotr have a better ending
even after 4 years i can feel the same worst ever and waste of series..<br><br>i can&#39;t be a lord but be a king..every stark child got what they want 😂😂😂...and most laughing thing that unsullied warrior asking justice to only one family 😂😂😂woh what a writing😅😅😅
i found this ending to mean that nothing has changed at all. , useless and dysfunctional court, and an absent king seeking out power,  just a different source of power.  no wheel was broken.
what an idiotic scene
so to win game of thrones you can’t play i guess.
good fanfic…
i stopped watching after the 3rd season. i must say though that this clip and the things they are discussing remind me of congress
bran being able to see everything past and future and he can&#39;t see drogon?
i keep thinking maybe i’ll binge the show again….and then i remember it all means nothing, the build up and everything in the end meant nothing
why would bronn even want to be a member of the small council
i rewatch my favorite shows every once a while. like the office, most of my childhood sitcoms and cartoons like avatar and pokémon, arrow (only first two seasons), the walking dead, and etc. but i just can’t let myself rewatch this show. seven seasons (season 6&amp;7 weren’t that bad imo) of character development and story building only for the entire show to become pointless in the 8th season. just wow. how can two guys who created one of the most popular shows on earth end it like this.
sir bronn came out the best of all. i loved his character, so i find consolation in that.
i never understand why bran is looking for drogon. its such a weird and sus moment
lord of lofty titles 😂
this feels like deleted b-roll footage from a bad parody of what could have been a great ending to a great show
lousy
bronn, the mercenary, is now on the small council and lord of highgarden???????? what????
&quot;i can&#39;t be the lord of anything&quot;<br><br>but king? yehh!
jon&#39;s claim should have been heard even if rejected then gendry with him being <br>legitimised by daenerys would have been next in line. can&#39;t be lord of winterfell but can be king of the 6 kingdoms.
terrible
it&#39;s like a bad fanfic.
for the folks defending the &#39;bran as king&#39; joke of a decision you need to realize that bran&#39;s &#39;gifts&#39; as the three-eyed raven wouldn&#39;t actually help him as a ruler -- at all. what many seem to forget is the type of people that inhabit this universe, as well as their awful realities/experiences in this world. there are literally millions of people (i&#39;d imagine) living in these kingdoms who for centuries and even very recently have known slavery, barbarism, greed, ambition, war, famine, stupidity, inbreeding and all sorts of other calamities and personality problems. bran, even with his dumb vision ability, wouldn&#39;t be able to magically solve or contain all or, perhaps, any of those issues, especially not with the joke of a council he has assembled here. this lighthearted scene, as well as some of the comments on this video, make it seem like all is just dandy now. all past grievances are magically wiped away. all ambitions and greed and thoughts of war and betrayal have just vanished because the three-eyed fucking raven suddenly, somehow put millions of people under a spell of kumbaya and peace and love, despite the realities of this kingdom that very recently experienced mass casualty events and leadership upheavals. what utter nonsense and terrible, terrible, terrible writing. it&#39;s also &gt;&gt;painfully&lt;&lt; obvious as to be laughingly embarrassing that d&amp;d re-watched the return of the king and tried to mimic how that trilogy wrapped things up....................and they failed miserably in every possible regard.<br><br>you do realize the writers pretty much just threw into a room the only main characters left on the show and left it to them to run the realm, regardless of their abilities? if bran did have leadership skills of any kind and knows everything (apparently), why not roll his dumb eyes back into his dull head and track down the smartest, most money-savvy and honest person in the entire kingdom and have that person in charge of coin? let me guess......because that person wasn&#39;t a character on the show! why not find the most talented, experienced, and intelligent grand maester in the entire kingdom and have that person on the council. let me guess....because that person wasn&#39;t a character on the show! think about it rationally: why has bran populated the council with only people he knows and have seen/interacted with recently? let me guess........because these are the only numbskulls the fans are familiar with and the writers got lazy as fuck as they rushed to wrap up this once-brilliant show. and to the argument that the hand is responsible for all human resource hiring decisions and therefor i should cut bran some slack: that still makes bran a terrible ruler (already) if he looks around that table, sees these numbskulls and doesn&#39;t take matters into his own hands or even comment on the ludicrous and mostly-inept council assembled before him (davos as the master of ships is a fine choice and brienne is tough as they come).<br><br>oh, and those other main characters they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what to do with they just sent to the wall or dora-exploring or went back to the north to rule where a revolt would have her head inside a week.<br><br>and to people saying that things would be fleshed out in upcoming books and grrm intended things to go as we saw on the show, that&#39;s a total cop-out. bad tv writing is still bad tv writing. i could give two shits what grrm&#39;s intentions are/were/will be if the tv show i&#39;m watching (watched) turns into absolute dogshit. d&amp;d became jokes because of their decisions on the last couple/few seasons of got and became the laughing stock of not just the internet, but of hollywood.
honestly this ending feels to me like d&amp;d were just trolling the audience. they seemed to get some perverse pleasure out of pissing people off, so i can definitely imagine them making all these decisions out of spite. &quot;we know it doesn&#39;t make sense, but do you know why we did it? because we can.&quot;
bran should’ve died when pushed out the window.  he had no purpose in this show.
how did bran become king again? was he next in line? weren&#39;t there other suitable nobles around? why would they elect a cripple as a king anyway? he can&#39;t fight or lead his army. can he even sire an heir?
&quot;sir podrick&quot;... wonder if sir brienne of tarth knighted him?<br>would have been nice to see the passing of the baton.
yeah you searching for that dragon cuz he&#39;s afraid daenerys could be resurrected i don&#39;t like him i don&#39;t really think i think it&#39;s still that old man inside him
bran is the master of whispers. tyrion is the actual king, bran is the figurehead. tyrion rules in secret while bran will get the credit in the history books. tyrion is doing the actual “ruling”.
this got ending is somehow boring.
bran becomes the king is the equivalent of walt jr. defeats neo-nazi in breaking bad finale despite spending his entire screen time by eating breakfasts
the funny thing is, by the time we reached this episode, i was mentally and emotionally checked out. nothing felt real, as in the writers did such a shitty job of writing, that i wasn&#39;t buying anything. this whole scene, the characters, the words they utter, it didn&#39;t feel like got. all i could hear was d&amp;d&#39;s words. this is like poorly written fan fiction to me.
as master of buttons, the second button literally makes or breaks the shirt.
the biggest blunder for sure is bran flakes being the king, but a very close runner up blunder here is bronn.<br>let&#39;s see... he is now lord of highgarden (basically the capital of the reach), who is also the lord paramount of the reach (basically all the lords of the reach now answer to him, some guy that isn&#39;t even from the reach), and who is also master of coin (who just a few seasons ago, was shown that he doesn&#39;t know how debts work).<br>and the cherry on top of this crap cake is that he wants to prioritize funding the reparations of brothels. not the ships which are vital to the economy... not the buildings which house their industries... not even the devastated country sides that produce their food for them. nah... bronn wants sex above all... westeros is doomed...
i thought it was interesting how bron cuts into conversation about where dragon is going. does he know something. can danarys be davey in a pit of fire??
i hope drogon comes back and burns them all, what a garbage ending to a great series.
i want someone to redeem season 8, by making season 9. where bran is slowly becoming obsessed by power, or rather. the entity called the three eyed raven that has innhabited him, revealing that this was always the three eyed ravens goal, but because the last one was trapped in the tree he couldn&#39;t, so he had to find a successor in order to fullfill his goal, a goal he was going to share with bran when he was ready, as stated before bran fucked up and made the night king aware of their location. whatever bran wasn&#39;t ready to learn in order to become the three eyed raven back then, as stated by the original three eyed raven, was this scheme. which will be revealed in season 9. the children of the forest also knows this, which is why they protect him, cause they&#39;ve been told that bran will attempt to go back in time to stop the creation of the night king, and therfore they support the three eyed raven in order to change their mistake. but what they don&#39;t know and by eventually doing so, bran becomes the night king, as he turns out to be the dude they pierce with that crystal thingy, making it all full circle. <br><br>now we got a few unanswered question to the plot solved, bran says he can&#39;t be king cause he is the three eyed raven, but later claims this has been his plan all along. which we now understand because he is scheming. <br><br>with brewing war and turmoil because of all the shit bran is up to, fatty mcarchmaester secretly sends a raven to jon snow to inquire help. <br>bringing him back from beyond the wall, where he stops at winterfell to catch up and exchange intel with sansa.  who doesn&#39;t give a fuck, she has the north and is contempt. also doesn&#39;t believe her brother is going mad with power. <br><br>(arya won&#39;t be in this season cause she has already travelled west) <br><br>jon, after the reveal of his heritage, is being adressed as jon stark by the north and the last targeryan by the south. many people, especially the supporters of old and stark loyalists from different houses (even tho sansa refuses to interfere) bans behind jon because they support his claim to the throne, which jon doesn&#39;t want but as time goes on it becomes clear that as bran becomes worse, jon needs to take it upon himself to claim the title for the greater good. which will make the whole plot about him being a targeryan relevant again. <br><br>this is also where the horn of winter came into play, as the nights watch didn&#39;t want to let jon and the wildlings supporting him back into the south, orders of the king of course. as there was no more white walkers jon chose to destroy the wall completely with the horn of winter that they found along with the dragonglass. <br><br>after a raven appears in winterfell a while after jons departure she would have no choice but to react to this whole mess as well, as it was from bran, basically ordering her to apprehend jon. cause he knew sam sent a raven to him, cause.. well he sees shit. he wouldn&#39;t stop it, because in his visions he needs jon and he needs him alive for [redacted] <br><br>this wouldn&#39;t be a war of the five kings or anything like that, but a westeross divided in 2. those who stays loyal to the throne and it&#39;s king and those who support it&#39;s rightfull heir and claim to the throne. targeryan heir. <br><br>bran also knows the location of drogon, his main goal in this war would be to prevent jon and drogon from finding each other at all costs, as he would be afraid that jon is able to bond with him and claim him as his dragon. <br><br>sam would be imprisoned for treason and ordered to be executed without trial, which would be the first wake up call that he is going mad, this is what makes davos, the honorable and honest man he is. change alliegence and abdicate his seat of power. tyrion is somewhat conflicted, but remembers his time with danny and will remember how he resigned the position as hand when she turned mad. he will do the same with bran, to his face because tyrion has balls. bran will naturally just let him go without any further inclination, he already has a replacement. bronn, cause bronn is a slimy dude that works for the highest bidder. <br><br>unfortunantly sam is executed, in public. by bronn, to serve as a warning to whomever crosses the king and the law, to spread fear amongst anyone who would dare rebel. <br><br>after the cleaning up of kings landing after dannys roidrage in season 8, they found the remains of the mountain and some of quburns research under the keep. that has been perserved because it was underground. bran has had a shady maester doing experiments for a while now, trying to reanimate the dead like qyburn did. his original plan was to reanimate brienne, after he lured her to her death. but for elaborate and detailed reasons i don&#39;t know at this time she managed to see through his shit, and escaped north with the help of tyrion and they along with davos manages to flee. davos being the only one injured. (arrow to the knee) he will be using a cane from this point out.
i love this ending just because i find hilarious to have both bronn and sam in the council
i feel like if jon had become the king, bran would have been a wonderful master of whispers
this may have been the only good part to that final season, god i loved that show but how it ended just makes me sad.
his first order of business: make all of kings landing handicap accessible
while i was annoyed at first, but as time went by, i started become amused by the fact that the two show runners, ruined and rushed the show final season because they wanted to make another show called confederate.<br><br>which later cancelled before it even began.<br><br>should&#39;ve focused on that last season.
he... he literally can be anywhere at any time..? man this season was so sh*t, it still doesn&#39;t feel real.
&quot;i can never be lord of winterfell. i can never be lord of anything. i&#39;m the three-eyed raven&quot;
after all that beautiful build-up over the years, they ruined the ending so spectacularly...sigh 😒
bran being king is, in my opinion, a kickass ending in the context of the books (cotf conspiracy - trying to get someone in power for millennia). <br><br>wish the show had done the story fully to give this ending justice.
bronn as the master of coin literally makes zero sense at all. he doesn&#39;t even know how loans work. this entire season is drizzling shits.
season 8 never happened.
the last two seasons, and the ending especially, is like bad fanfiction directed by a 14yo and overseen and produced by darth kennedy. for almost 5 seasons this was top 3 best tv shows of all time, then it plummet down like a bad smelly turd and in the end so badly done that to this day i feel sick even seeing a taste of this filth.
best scene ive seen so far of this show. ive only watched clips on youtube but this whole show seems like a terrible copy of conan the barbarian and lord of the rings. its like some fat nerd tried to merge them and throw a hint of &quot;heavy metal&quot; into it. lame
why isn’t gendry king? i mean he was the kings son, bastard son yes, but his son. just imagine it king gendry and queen/master of whispers arya.
i wanted the very last scene to be drogon in valyria laying dragon eggs with danys body nearby and one of the eggs hatches and the baby dragon screeches and the screen turns to black and the credits role.
sorry i am slow. best ending, amazing. i watch one more and move on.
they utterly ruined bran. made him completely boring and uninteresting. hope gr martin lives long enough to finish those books and give him a better ending.
i wonder if the cannibal dragon is still alive?
stupidity
we don`t really need a new series about what happened long ago in the past, what we need and deserve is a future series that tells us what happens next after this scene and especially to our favourite and beloved members of the cast.
it&#39;s so weird how they call him &quot;bran the broken.&quot; this whole scene felt like it was written by ai.
&quot;bran the broken&quot;. <br>dang, just call him king wheels while you&#39;re at it 😭
painful
gottdamn travesty. they trashed everything.
bron should have been the master of war none the less, but who am i to tell d&amp;d how to write a terrible story.
bran the broken is the worst name they could give him. shouldve been bran the seer or something like that
season 5 mid season 6 bad seasons 7-8 dog shit
everyone talking about season 8 being terrible fail to realize there was literally zero book content or lore available to continue the series. the series was told they would only have one more season so they literally had to make up the entire ending on their own. that is why season 8 feels and sounds so swiftly wrapped up. where character plots abruptly ended or changed dramatically. george martin told them how he thought the series would end but he was to slow of a writer to keep caught up with game of thrones.<br><br>like based off the build up to season 8, there should&#39;ve honestly been 1 more season. half of season 8 should&#39;ve been about the white walkers winning in the north and pushing south to kings landing. <br><br>season 9 should&#39;ve been were they dealt with cersei.<br><br>shoulda,woulda,coulda.<br><br>none of us could&#39;ve really done better on such a short notice of filming and wrapping up a story.
seems more like bronn was saying long. may he reign? lol
they couldn’t write proper scenes anymore, so instead they just filled it with fan service, hoping the viewers would be distracted by the fan service and overlook the piss poor writing.
such vaguely defined powers....
say what you want about season 8. you cant deny that this is one of the season of all time. its so poetic and full of subtle reference like bron being a ladies man, davis being a ship man, and bran being broken because seeing him in wheelchair alone is not enough to remind him that he is a disabled person
this is the great value version of a heads table
&quot;bran the broken, bran the op&quot;
he gets to be hand of the king, and jon gets nights watch. tyrion committed treason also
and we still didn&#39;t hear what happened next in that brothel
i still can&#39;t get over how the guy who bascially did a one month internship at the citadel is now somehow qualified to become the grand maester, over literally all other maesters in the seven kingdoms who actually have experience
such a dumb, anticlimatic scene.
that scene is so disgusting
and the memes are just writing themselves
while the banter of the counsil of people whom have been through hell together was slightly amusing this ending was highly disappointing.
this is so shit but its especially funny that everyday tyrion reminds him that he&#39;s a cripple.
in season 1-3 we had a proper small council. now we have the b squad..
in other words, he&#39;s gonna go play dragon flight simulator 3000 instead of ruling
president biden: &#39;what?&#39;
no one would follow bran the broken, there would a be a war or coup within weeks. outside of immediate family members, the public would be against a wheel chaired bound kid, who has no political or military experience. like the previous rulers.
lord of lofty titles lol
when jon is the direct heir to the throne in kings landing how come this cripple was choosen ?? that still goes beyond my head
we are the master of whisperers, collectively, we who watched this.<br><br>and, all these years later, we&#39;re whispering together about it, still.
they look all very fearful 😰
the ending sucks thank you writers
i can&#39;t believe this is actually the ending of game of thrones 😂😂😂
bronn being here is the biggest travesty ever i cant even believe they gave this man highgarden and the reach!! the hightowers and all others houses cant have possibly accepted a sell sword
what a crew, a master of coin that doesn&#39;t know how borrowing money works, a master of ships that lost his only naval battle, a grand maestre that isn&#39;t a maestre, a king that &quot;can&#39;t be king of anything&quot;. only tyrion and brienne are good at their jobs
in the end the have kind  people in the small council but all are clueless about what to do.
bran the boring.
why is brand looking for drogo? i know it 😁
another reason the finale was trash and d&amp;d are talentless hacks is that they established podrick as a sexual prodigy, then had him take a vow of chastity while in his prime 🙄
i hope jon kills this worthless f**k in the spinoff…
1 of the best series set alight 😂
if you showed someone this scene during season 4 they’d think it was an snl skit
everything is so wrong.
still don&#39;t get how he can be a three eyed raven without his trees, they were all destroyed in the south
shame!<br>shame!<br>shame! <br>ding ding ding!
all season 8 got clips on youtube should be reported and banned, i&#39;m serious. i don&#39;t want to see this shit on my suggestions and feeds.
i wonder<br>only once
drogon was last spotted flying back to season 5 when got was still an amazing show.
honestly, if the last two seasons were just this. it&#39;d be way better.
bran looks like he just got done smoking a fat joint of the best weed in westeroes !!<br><br>8s sucked so bad.
so..300 hundred years of targaryen rule, 15 years of baratheon rule, and, this is your new government westoros 😬....good luck
next time make sure you will have source material in time.
if they ever put up a top ten worst television scenes in history this surely makes the list. it just manages to tick every box of awfulness.
that was so, so…unconvincing.
why does this seem like a blooper
tyrion should be on the throne. the one character who always let good judgement lead him. he did some stupid things, but always remained good.
so rude of tyrion not to stand up with everyone else...
got - you were supposed to be the greatest tv show of all time ..... and now, look at this stupid ending! disappointing!
this creep better stay away from drogon!
oh wow, good thing professor xavier pretends to be &quot;surprised&quot; about not having a full small council and not knowing where drogon is.....even though he literally knows and sees everyone and everything in the entire fu^king world!!!<br> what tumblr fanfiction writer did those 2 bumbling aretards let into the writers room when making this last season?
i haven&#39;t even seen this episode, seems i was really pissed before :d
i find this ending so weird. davos is sitting next to 2 people who is the reason he was almost killed and his son died. and just has to ignore it?
this feels like a light spoof or something for a  late night show shot for promotion. got was supposed to be a show that takes pride in being serious and watertight in every expect. what a waste. f u d &amp; d
most useless character.
sigh...
i love this
sad end to the series. bran is gonna be a terrible king, he has unlimited knowledge and power, and little humanity. he will likely end up as a sort of socialistic tyrant, quashing rights, freedom and property for the greater good of the kingdoms, and any attempts to overthrow or circumnavigate him he can see in their entirety and crush accordingly
bronn gets highgarden? wtf?
one of the most stupid stubrn character became the most important person and won the troffy. he started not istenning to his mom and fell from tower. he didn&#39;t listen 3 eyed raven and called his young father. then he didn&#39;t train himself yet kept going in the past. eventually he was touched and marked by the night king. apparently he didn&#39;t graduate as a 3 eyed raven and obviously very inefficient one. the world&#39;s fate rely on such idiots. just like dumb &amp; dumbest.
now thats how you do a rushed ending. put a zip lock by putting good old sweet comedy.
lord of lofty titles. lol
this scene annoys me so much. bran as king ruined the whole thing for me.
i was waiting for the seinfeld theme to play between scenes.
pain
toți corupți care erau în fim a castigat ca și în reala viata, corupția predomina în tot sistemul lumii
tot serialul sa sfârșit corupt cred  ca și în filme a ajuns corupția
dany merita sa fie regina sfarsitul e foarte corupt
it should&#39;ve been jon (aegon vi) not bran 😔
comments section: wah wah wah wah.
i&#39;ll be that lone voice then. i thought this scene was heartwarming.
gotta love the small council!  and people still bitch about season 8...
don&#39;t understand why bran is all serious. you can fun and all-knowing. infact, you can choose not to see things and experience surprise anyways.
lmao @ lord of lofty titles
i wanna know how wheelchair boy got up all those stairs
&quot;that will improve&quot;<br>&quot;i&#39;m sure it will&quot;<br><br>based off bran&#39;s reaction i&#39;m really hoping he saw into the future it in fact did not improve 😂
compare season one opening scene with this final scene...&quot; see the difference&quot;?
bronn about the drogon:farther away the better<br>the fans:stfu we litteraly wanna know where he is!
i ignore this part, i stoted watching this serie when they killed dany😮 shay finished and boried
if this final season would have been 2 full seasons, and no offense, but jon should have been the one to kill the night king (prince that was promised, not princess) then this ending would have been fine. it was entirely too rushed
the series should have ended when jon killed dany.  all the wrap up was garbage.  maybe 5 seconds of arya sailing, jon going north of the wall and sansa on the winterfell throne.. with just music.
it is a nice fan theory but too bad that none of this happened and the show never had a finale. i guess we&#39;ll never know.
this feels like a multiversal alternate ending
this looks like a parody 😂
i can&#39;t recall having watched this scene, just watching it now and wondering when did they shoot parody extra scenes and how did i miss that? was it for jimmy kimmel&#39;s show or something? and then that deadly suspicion comes to me.... omg should i dare imagine that this scene was in the actual show?? i remember that the last episode was an absolute abomination but was it that bad?!? shit, now i &#39;ll have to reforget this!!.. :/
i like the way brienne has just abandoned sansa despite being sworn to her. bronn as master of coin is a walking disaster. the grand maester is not qualified to be grand maester. won’t be long before master of coin and master of ships are arguing. this council is going to wreck westeros. meanwhile the king is more interested in searching for dragons. besides where is this meeting taking place? red keep was destroyed.
the most pathetic end ever
bring back the queen daenerys and then we will accept these fools as king of sing. 😂
everything in the scene seems like a parody of the original game of thrones i am still mad at how it ended
what a terrible ending
season 1 : aegon first of his name, lord tywin hand of the king, queen cersei lannister, queen dannaerys - broker of chains<br><br>season 8 : my broken raven all hail to the king with the least screen time in the show and most skipped part also
jfc leave drogon alone he&#39;s suffered enough.
this was so bad i forgot how bad it was
i beg you dont disrespect my pet hussein malin ahmed!!!!
hussein malin ahmed/sir bron or whatever..........wouldnt you say im the shit???.......good girl!!!!!
professor xavier in medival times
such a great group the kingdom is in very very good hands
brandon is weird and creepy
this is so ridiculous i hate the way this ended
i thought drogon pretty much destroyed the red keep and the rest of the city??!. that room looks in good condition
this dwarf is the reason for darneys death
i would actually like this scene as a skit, but for it to be an actual, literal part of the series is just bafflingly retarded.
seinfeld ending
bran will be king, but the context is going to be so different. <br><br>there won’t be a king’s landing to rule. he will rule from harrenhal. <br><br>none of the characters here will be on his council, lol.
such a weak scene. it felt like a joke
someday, after i&#39;ve read the winds of winter, i&#39;ll come back and watch this video and laugh at how disappointed i was the season 8 was the &quot;end&quot;.
what a waste
it needs that seinfeld scene transition sound at the end.
we need another season the ending was terrible writing
the bickering at the end was better than most of the second half of the series 😂
brans presence at the meeting is so short you wonder why he even bothered to show up in the first place
this scene made me feel like i was watching snl 😂😂😂 lmao... too pathetic to be near any good... what a joke...
this show ended so horribly lmao<br>what a waste
honestly i think tyrion should have been king, and could have been. it would have been amazing to see him standing on the iron throne as an ending scene, that little man holding that much power because he is a great man. would be a great symbolic of how power comes from wisdom, not looks and tyrany.
best scene and a perfect ending of a great serie..😊👍
perhaps i can find him. bruh you the greenseer who you think was gonna look
the people who won the game
do you really want brienne guarding you? it&#39;s basically a death sentence.
such a horrible last season
bran the  crippled
wtf is this shit
bronn would never be on the council and he also would never be lord of highgarden.. that&#39;s literally less realistic than bran being king
sam spends 1 day at the citadel and becomes grand maester. brienne is a sworn sword to sansa yet is here for...reasons. bronn is master of coin but doesn&#39;t know how loans work. not to mention probably the worst person for the job. davos just chilling with the man that fired the arrow that torched his son, the man that orchestrated it and the woman who killed his king. wtf is this council
this is number one worst endings in series history
the last seasons were bad, but they had good scenes. i enjoyed this scene a lot, but i don&#39;t know how i feel about it for an ending. the writing just not being consistent with past seasons makes it feel incomplete.
this is what it looks like when producers run out of script and have no idea what they&#39;re doing :)
brandon took a position he didn&#39;t want.  the only good thing he doesn&#39;t covet politics power he has mystic power and plus he can go into animals bodies.
this scene is an absolute mess. bran asking about the master of whisperers even though he&#39;s the all-seeing three-eyed raven, then leaving after just 1 minute. bronn interrupting sam for no good reason, also bronn being master of coin despite him knowing nothing about finances. tyrion ending the scene by repeating a joke he&#39;d already made before...
i don’t get why everyone’s crying about this ending? what more could you want than ned starks children finally finding peace, the north becoming independent and bran on the throne ? for me it was perfect the only downside was it was a bit out of character for john to just stab daenerys like that
i love that the last line tyrion has is &quot;i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel . . . &quot;  it&#39;s even perfect that we never get to hear the end of the joke, because it can&#39;t possibly be better than the setup.
it&#39;s like the three eyed raven planned all of it. the fact jon wasn&#39;t made kind was stupid. he said i can never be king i&#39;m the three eyed raven but becomes the king of everything. hmmm
the final 🖕 to the fan base
has all the shallow wit and banter of a &#39;90s sitcom. jesus christ.
this looks like a parody
i don’t know what the complaining is about. the most loyal, honest, and good people became the most powerful. i loved all of the characters that rose to call themselves part of a king’s council, and they were all deserving.
season 8 is like wiping my ass and never getting it clean.
fuck this show,wasted my time watching from season 1 to season 8 for the fuck trash ending
the only good thing about this scene was when tyrion goes &quot;that will improve&quot; and bran&#39;s amused &quot;i&#39;m sure it will.&quot; i don&#39;t know why but that amuses me.
i really can&#39;t believe that mr. bronn had made it so far to be the one executive council of the kingdom 😁
bran = professor x
when you literally do absolutely nothing to be king.  brandon being king made no sense whatsoever.  like really.  it’s like the d&amp;d couldn’t figure out who should be king.  so they drew names out of a hat
a handicapped teenager as king, a sell sword as a master of coin, a hand of the king who has been outed as a traitor (twice) , no master of whispers , a loose dragon and the north is now independent. the country would’ve entered into chaos within a single day
so bad, but the worst is they even grow back all the people in the kingslanding, so they have a lot of hungry people to feed now besides undead unsullied and dothraki xd
honestly seeing bron, sam, briana and tyrion on the council makes the ending a little easier to swallow. they all deserve those seats. just  wish we had another season to see this council in the works even with king bran who i think as high king the spot of master of whispers is kind of pointless because the king sees all and hears all. bran is too op as king.<br>i know it cliche but it should be jon as king and bran as master of whispers that just makes more sense
pathetic
knight like k night king night night king
@28 &quot;perhaps i can find him&quot; no no no no no   leave the poor dragon alone! if there is ever a sequel to this (and i doubt it) and brandon finds drogon and then i guess tries to bring him to kinds landing? well, that would be a mistake on so many levels #1 drogon will set fire to everything #2 drogon will no longer have any peace that he may have been enjoying away from people! #3 just a bad idea in general.. leave it be. i just had to say it. i&#39;ve watched this show over and over (skipping parts i really don&#39;t like) and every time i noticed more and more details that i either thought were good or very bad. i don&#39;t think brandon should&#39;ve been king at all it makes zero sense. as to who should&#39;ve been king if all these events occurred? good question. jon (aka aegon targaryen) might have made a good king but i don&#39;t think so as he had way too much baggage and did not want it. my real pet peeve is sansa stark getting to be warden of the north? oh, come on! that should&#39;ve been brandon (if jon was still sent to the wall) as it makes so much more sense. i was just &quot;googling&quot; what ending most people wanted as i&#39;ve read so much about how people didn&#39;t like it as i was curious. i will tell you i do not like the new show in any way shape or form even if others do as each to his/her/their own. for one thing they ruined the way the dragons looked! i just do not like it but perhaps i&#39;m the only one? i also don&#39;t like that they brought in this imitation daenerys targaryen (that&#39;s how i see it/her) and sorry but no! she is (the character anyway) annoying! everyone with half a brain knows the show writers were/are trying to resurrect the love people had for daenerys and as far as i&#39;m concerned they were wrong. i&#39;ve made this long enough as i get on a roll and could go on but i won&#39;t! lol
the most imcompetent small council we have ever seen
just seeing these &quot;lords&quot; interact for less than a minute makes me believe that westeros will be ruled into the ground within a year after the houses who hate the starks rise up in rebellion to storm a broken king&#39;s landing and the north itself falls apart because sansa decided to break away from her only ally left with a bunch of poor houses who will surely starve in the coming winter.
zaldrizes buzdari iksos daor. a dragon is not a slave, bran the usurper.
bronn, if true to his character would have never wanted to be part of the small council. as commander of the city watch he was so not serious about it and was focused only on money.<br><br>this whole scene seems like the show writers were focused on fanfare and not the story, like someone in the writers room said &quot;well now that the show is established with fans of certain characters, wouldnt it be cool if all the fan fav&#39;s ended up ruling the kingdoms?&quot; samwell tarley just doesnt make sense either, just a lazy pick for the grand maester. its like, &quot;we need a maester on the council, whos a character thats also a maester and a fan favorite? samwell!&quot; and they just pushed him into that position. he wasnt anywhere near kings landing in any way. i also think brienne is a stretch. the only person that makes sense is sir davos
yuck. all those starks where yuck. they suddenly received ploy armor.
king brandon the wheelie legs no feelie
hey look, it&#39;s bran the broken. 🙄
bran: we appears to be missing a master of whisperers.<br>me: you can thank your hand of the king for that one.
i fear for drogon if bran is hunting him.
at the end the stark offspring ruled westeros. a happy ending.
i mean like... this is the end of it. this is what we got. ugh..
it became an awkward comedy
extremely shit. bran is the most annoying character in got and that says a lot in a show that had joffrey
i was so disappointed in the speed of the ending that i missed the general banter. &quot;you master of grammar now?&quot; made me laugh.
and there&#39;s that unfinished joke again
i forgot how incredibly bad this was. like they spit in the face of the fans who’d been watching for 8 years.
haha, look at this clusterfuck! tyrion&#39;s words almost seem snide
it almost feels like the writers were so pissed off by the criticism the got for the past couple seasons that they decided to write this ending to piss off the fans even more. almost any other character would have been better than bran. he became devoid of emotion and that made him a boring character. he stated he couldn&#39;t be king. would have been better if we got:<br>sansa who was the victim and basically prisoner of kingslanding and became its queen. <br>gendry- who grew up with the commoners and would look after their best interests. he became robert&#39;s rightful heir<br>jon- the rightful heir as a targayean. the man who was a bastard and fought with the lowest of low. united the wildlings and has leadership experience. <br>tyrion- has leadership experience and is smart. he was the most disrespected person growing up and cares for the people. <br><br>the of these characters could have been good rulers of westeros.
i didn&#39;t mind him becoming king because he would make for the best king. no bs, no desires, he can know when someone is lying etc. he would make the most perfect king thats for the people if you really think about it.
i think bran will use dragon as his slave
i just wanna know what castle they are in
i don’t know why he’s looking for a master of whisperer?
all of that fighting for rulership, to just end up chatting about the sewerage system at castle rock?? 🤣🤣
you all should go and watch season 9 by talking thrones. all these will make more sense then. even though it&#39;s fan fiction, it&#39;s far far better ending than what d&amp;d gave us
i feel that the final season was as much of a disappointment as anyone, but i think this scene is subtler than most. i think it shows the true tragedy of daenerys targaryen because of its seinfeldian quality. <br><br>and i mean seinfeldian. seinfeld ended with the characters (in jail) having exactly the same conversation they had at the beginning. i don&#39;t remember, but i would bet that this debate is at least very similar to ned starks first small council.<br><br>and that brings home daenerys&#39;s tragedy. she wanted to &quot;break the wheel&quot;, really change things, but in the end the wheel is still rolling and daenerys was the one that was broken.
season 8 is basically bad fan fiction.
this scene makes me puke
so uncomfortable. even the actors are thinking wtf are we doing here together
did they ever explain how he is supposed to reproduce? is he even still able to do so? i mean chances are high, either his body or crow raped mind would prevent him from doing so right?<br><br>that would be his most important job besides ruling tho. that’s how kings work.
thinking again, this idea of ending is actually very good, considering all the shit that happened between the seven kingdoms and essos (&quot;well, we are the ones that are left now, we must get the kingdom moving, somehow&quot;).<br><br>everyone is somber, sad and, barring very few exceptions, no one won anything meaningful of all that.<br><br>the big issue is that the execution of the idea was atrocious (season 8 and the first half of season 7 felt empty, devoid of the magic of the first five seasons)
fanfavor episodes, greed ruined the best series ever made into some fan fest sitcom 💩, if you read the books 📚 you’ll see material for 5 more series better than this one.
loved this scene! such a great ending to a great story!
i must be in the minority because i enjoyed season 8.  sure...big atmospheric change...so.....??<br>people will kick...even with their feet tied.
they messed up. the little guy should have died. he killed the queen. this was so messed up. they need to go back and fix the last season
let&#39;s go brandon
bran asking where drogon is, then decides to find him himself since he is the only one who can &quot;see&quot; it. what a mess.
i don&#39;t mind bran being king, that is actually better than the typical character becoming king or queen. what i hate is how everything was done. thanks dd.
this scene demonstrates that the wheel continues to turn.
i hated this scene and also the one in the dragonpit. felt like it was made by a high school drama club
feels like a sitcom ending.
i remind all and everyone who bitches and complains (rightly so) about the quality of the writing at the end .... it&#39;s only because the story&#39;s actual author couldn&#39;t be arsed to finish the bloody story himself.
on the short list of things i want in my life is the rest of that joke...
brothels are definitely more important than anything
is tryion ever going to get to finish that joke?!
he just leaves because …? he has better shit to do or what? does the rest not concern him? no he left cuz the writers felt it best for them to include the awkward greeting and the argument over brothels or ships
ahhh if only i could hear the rest of the joke, &#39;i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel....&#39;
these producers benioff and weis were so far at bronn&#39;s a** they couldn&#39;t chew the food for...
too bad varys wasn’t there
wow, they&#39;re really just gonna keep calling him king bran the broken throughout his entire reign aren&#39;t they. because that&#39;s totally not a shitty thing to call a king to his face at all. /s
you simply have to admire how the uniforms continue to look the same. the same robes, same armour, same dress code. hell, it should eba time of change
don&#39;t care bron got his castle
oddly appropriate that the last line of dialogue in the series is a joke with no punchline
davos and brianne i understand, tyrion too, but bronn? bronn?? he may have wanted a castle but a seat on the small council???
they still owed the iron bank a gargantuan amount of money and they forgot all about it already. they even picked bronn as master of coin who knew nothing about loan or money management. the reign of bran the broken would be short and tragic.
king inang yn npkapangit ng ending..s bndang huli ung inutil p ang naging hari..
wonderful scene, finally, the right people are in the right places :)
when it&#39;s your turn to dm
i&#39;m surprised tyrion didn&#39;t say yes to the brothels
i wonder if season 8 was an fu to martin for not finishing the books. a total power play
how was this allowed to happen?
bron trying to act formal like he cares and trying to show respect lmao..
starks aren’t a part of the now six kingdoms, so how is bran the king? and if bran warned no one about what daenerys was going to do, then does he really deserve to be the king? good job as always, tyrion. no wonder your father didn’t like you
can someone please tell me how they&#39;re sitting in the red keep after dany leveled the entire building/city literally one episide ago?
i&#39;m afraid king &#39;big brother&#39; bran the all seeing tree wizard will be around for a <i>very long time</i><br><br>“what do the trees remember?”<br><br>“the secrets of the old gods,” said jojen reed. <br><br>food and fire and rest had helped restore him after the ordeals of their journey, but he seemed sadder now, sullen, with a weary, haunted look about the eyes. <br><br>“truths the first men knew, forgotten now in winterfell … but not in the wet wild. we live closer to the green in our bogs and crannogs, and we remember. earth and water, soil and stone, oaks and elms and willows, they were here before us all and will still remain when we are gone.”<br><br><i>“so will you,” said meera</i><br><br>that made bran sad. <br><br>what if i don’t want to remain when you are gone? he almost asked, but he swallowed the words unspoken. <br><br>he was almost a man grown, and he did not want meera to think he was some weepy babe.<br><br>“maybe you could be greenseers too,” he said instead.<br><br>“no, bran.” now meera sounded sad.<br><br>“it is given to a few to drink of that green fountain whilst still in mortal flesh, to hear the whisperings of the leaves and see as the trees see, as the gods see,” said jojen. “most are not so blessed. the gods gave me only greendreams. my task was to get you here. my part in this is done.”
i only see ser davos being in the small council, if there is one, in the end of the books. tyrion (kingslayer and kinslayer), brienne (too much of a knight wannabe to sit, high chance of dying), samwell (oldtown would never appoint someone so young to the small council), bronn (he won&#39;t get any of those titles, he&#39;s not even close, but he should get stokeworth castle and have children with lady lollys though). i deffs see podrick becoming a good swordsman, so he should be able to become a kingsgaurd if he survives, dudes been in too many battles.
it feels like a bad parody
idk why but i hate to hear bran talk, he just sounds like the perfect avatar for the last season, no soul, no wit, no fun.
i tought brandon couldnt be a king😂😂
i&#39;m always happy to see tyrion.
compare and contrast s01 and s08 finales - 1,500 words by monday svp
season 7 and 8 are awful with only certain scenes that were good
friend groups in any group projects be like:
there are just 6 kingdoms now? wich one is missing? you can do all the spoilers you want i&#39;ll allow it.
the north is independent, wish means brand is an outaiser, and he is allowed to be king? iant there a conflict of interests?
wish verys was there in the small council
what a parody
this scene is so wooden, anyone who has eyes can see this season was written by some 5 year old. and that&#39;s being generous.
“we appear to be missing grrm’s imagination and have substituted shite quality fan fiction, your grace”<br><br>the ending seasons remind me of the old joke about group projects:<br><br>“when i die, i’d like the other people i did group projects with to lower the coffin, so they can let us all down one more time” <br><br>the show runners got $1million each per show in final seasons 😂😂😂
i wouldn&#39;t mind a got spin off that involved this new council
let&#39;s be honest, it would be 4 kingdoms in the best case scenario
how about this for a few changes i would make to this mess. brienne gets pregnant from jamie so goes back to rule house tarth and raise a badass child. davos was close to jon snow, so he would probably go where jon goes. since sam&#39;s bro and father were burnt to death, he should be running house tarly. the table could be tyrion, bronn, pod, sansa as queen (with jon in the north), alongside bran who wheels in on rare occasions to give his dull but useful insight such as weather forecasts, and hotpie who will be in charge of catering.<br>...and a random giant called num leg, because giants are cool and we learn they aren&#39;t all dead yay!!
bran the broken cause he broke his back gtfoh. long live the queen.
what’s that fat boy’s name? hotpot? he should be the master of whispers. they could aso hire a foreigner like turmond as a master of war.
the greatest villain of this show was not the night king nor cercie nor tywin nor ramsy <br>but this stupid three eyed raven high on dope
what is the punchline of that damn joke?
why would he have to ask where drogon is?
it&#39;d be interesting to see that actually bran was the villain from the beginning and at last triumphing... trying to make some sense out of this bag of shit!!
if he&#39;s the 3eyed raven....why doesn&#39;t he know where drogon is? more importantly...why does he need a master of secrets...if he&#39;s the 3eyed raven? s8 sucked so badly
the ending screwed up the whole series why does nobody mention that jon snow is the promised prince and his true identity is aegon targaryen😠
shit ending.
is sam going to be the king&#39;s personal ass-wiper now?
bran as king doesn’t work well
worst ending ever....
the scene was suppose to be funny and it wasn&#39;t even making us smile... ohhhh!!! how they ruined the best show to be ever made!!! f**k dnd
dumbass show
they literally said ah fuck it let’s just make him king !!
i wish i could be as invested in something so much that i would hate it the way gamw of thrones fans hate the ending
first time shit hits the fan in the realm, bronn´s gonna ran off to essos with all the money.
bran: guys, can you stop calling me the broken, it&#39;s not cool..
